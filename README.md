# Weak symmetries in quantum jump Monte Carlo

This repository contains the source code used to generate the results in the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08492). This consists of general code for translation symmetries in spin-1 systems, and symmetry-respecting quantum jump Monte Carlo for systems with two commuting weak symmetries. This is applied to a simple model with nearest neighbour interactions and single-site dissipation, with translation and rotation invariance.
